The Czech Travel Card comes in various forms, including mobile eSIMs, physical SIM cards, and data-only SIM cards. Each type caters to different needs, ensuring that you can choose the option that best suits your travel style. For instance, if you prefer the convenience of not carrying extra hardware, the eSIM is your go-to solution.
