Setting up your Columbia SIM card is straightforward. Most providers have user-friendly websites where you can select your preferred package and complete the purchase online. Once purchased, follow the instructions provided to activate your service either by inserting the physical SIM into your phone or downloading the eSIM profile via QR code scanning.
