You can easily purchase and activate it online before your trip, ensuring that you hit the ground running as soon as you arrive.

Now, letâ€™s talk about the types of cards available. If youâ€™re someone who prefers having a physical SIM card in hand, the traditional SIM-based tourist card might be perfect for you.
